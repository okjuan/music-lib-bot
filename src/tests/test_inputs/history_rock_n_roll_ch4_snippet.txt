Performers such as Lonnie Donegan ("Rock Island Line," 1954), Tommy Steele ("Rock with the Caveman," 1956), and Billy Fury ("Halfway to Paradise," 1961) pioneered as pop stars within England...

Perhaps the two most authentic early progenitors of a legitimate British adaptation of rock 'n' roll were Cliff Richard (and the Shadows) and Screaming Lord Sutch (and the Savages). Both bands, behind their agitated leaders, exhibited a daring and ostentatious flair that appealed to and played off of youthful tensions, rather than deflected them. They came to prominence in the 1960-61 time frame—Cliff Richard in particular was a big star, with several British Number One hits through 1963 ("Livin' Doll," 1959 was the first and possibly biggest, even reaching Number 30 in the U.S.)—a time when young English men were exerting increasing independence and rebelliousness, and developing a sense of identity as a group similar to American rock 'n' rollers in the mid-fifties.

It's interesting that the Rolling Stones, easily the most enduringly popular and prolific rock band of all, are still essentially defined by their first major hit (#1 in the U.S. for 4 weeks in the summer of 1965; "Time is On My Side" had reached Number Six in 1964). They've had—how many?—forty, fifty albums, scores of hit singles, and even though their legend has grown out of sight, they have never really improved upon their initial masterpiece, "Satisfaction". (You know, it's the record companies that insist on elaborating on song titles with parentheticals like "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" and "Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)". They think record buyers are too clueless to learn the names of songs if they aren't articulately repeated two dozen times in the chorus. Jagger and Richard didn't name it "Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo," they just sang it that way; the title was "Heartbreaker," but the execs figured that fans might confuse it with Grand Funk's or Led Zeppelin's "Heartbreaker"s, so they said, "Why don't we put that doo-doo stuff in the title so the kids will know which one they're buying?"
